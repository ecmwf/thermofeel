Overview of thermofeel
======================================

*thermofeel* is a thermal indices library which allows these indices to be integrated in numerical weather prediction systems. 
It was developed and is maintained by ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts).

*thermofeel* calculates the following thermal indices:
* Apparent Temperature
* Heat Index
* Humidex
* Normal Effective Temperature
* Universal Thermal Climate Index
* Wet Bulb Globe Temperature
* Wind Chill

In support of the above, it also calculates:
* Globe Temperature
* Mean Radiant Temperature
* Mean Radiant Temperature from Globe Temperature
* Relative Humidity Percentage
* Saturation Vapour Pressure
* Wet Bulb Temperature
