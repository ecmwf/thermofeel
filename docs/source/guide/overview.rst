Overview of thermofeel
======================================

*thermofeel* is a thermal indices library which allow these indices to be integrated in numerical weather prediction systems. 
It was developed and is maintained by ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts).

*thermofeel* calculates the following thermal indices:
* Universal Thermal Climate Index
* Apparent Temperature
* Heat Index Adjusted
* Heat Index Simplified
* Humidex
* Normal Effective Temperature
* Wet Bulb Globe Temperature
* Wet Bulb Globe Temperature Simple
* Wind Chill
In support of the above, it also calculates:
* Globe Temperature
* Mean Radiant Temperature
* Mean Radiant Temperature from Globe Temperature
* Relative Humidity Percentage
* Saturation vapour pressure
* Wet Bulb Temperature
