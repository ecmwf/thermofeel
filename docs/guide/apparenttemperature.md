# Apparent Temperature

The Apparent Temperature (AT) is defined as the temperature giving the same
discomfort as under the current ambient temperature and humidity.

The AT is based on a mathematical model of human body heat balance for an adult,
walking outdoors in the shade.

Absolute humidity conforming with a dew point of 14 °C is chosen as a reference.
If ambient humidity is:

- higher than the reference humidity level, the apparent temperature will be
  higher than the ambient temperature.
- lower than the reference humidity level, the apparent temperature will be
  lower than the ambient temperature.

## How to use

You need 2 m air temperature in Kelvin, 10 m wind speed in metres per second and
relative humidity as a percentage.

It returns the apparent temperature in Kelvin.

```python
calculate_apparent_temperature(2m_temperature, 10m_wind_speed, relative_humidity_percent)
```
